### About

This is a cross-platform app built with C++ and programmatic Qt which offers a class structure for reading, parsing, plotting, analyzing and saving the data read from a selected system serial port. Options are available to export the sorted data as .json, .xls/.xlsx, or .csv, as well as save an image of the plot.

It is meant as a small part of a larger serial communications application for remote monitoring and control of devices equipped with Bluetooth and WiFi modules. It can also serve as an example class structure for communication through other protocols like TCP/IP.

* Parses incoming serial data and extracts meaningful samples
* Exports data to .csv, .xls,. json, .xlsx
* Saves an image of the current plot
* Selects available system ports in the `Port > Choose Port...` menu
