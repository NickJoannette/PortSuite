Re-usable class structure and cross-platform application for reading serial ports, parsing, plotting, and saving data. Opens and closes a selected system serial port, reads, parses, and plots incoming data from a sensor or whatever may be transmitted by the peripherals (in the example case a signal from a Hall sensor communicated through an arduino).
