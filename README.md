A re-usable class structure and cross-platform application for reading, parsing, plotting, and saving the data read from a selected system serial port. 

Can export the numerical data as .xls, .csv, or .json. Currently configured to read hall sensor data from an arduino. Meant to be combined into a larger serial control station application.
